# AquaClense: Integrated Aquatic Cleaning System

-----

## Overview

**AquaClense** is a software prototype designed to combat **water pollution** in canal water bodies with significant waste accumulation. It offers **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **public awareness** tools, with plans for future integration with a **hardware device** for debris removal. The goal is to scale this solution to enhance water quality management and environmental sustainability.

-----

## Objectives

  * **Data Analysis:** Process water quality and waste data to enable predictive water management.
  * **Public Awareness:** Visualize canal waste metrics to educate and engage communities.
  * **Future Hardware Integration:** Support a planned debris-removal device (190×100×150 mm).
  * **Sustainability:** Adhere to ethical, socially responsible, and environmentally sustainable practices.

-----

## Features

  * **Data Pipeline:** Analyzes water quality and waste data for actionable insights.
  * **Visualization Dashboard:** Displays real-time canal waste and water quality metrics.
  * **Scalable Design:** Supports a 5-day initial deployment, adaptable for hardware integration.
  * **Community Focus:** Promotes canal restoration awareness through accessible data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhinavdev369/AquaClense.git
    cd AquaClense
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-----

## Usage

### Running the Software

  * **Data Collection:**
    Process simulated or manual water/waste data:

    ```bash
    python scripts/data_collection.py
    ```

  * **Dashboard:**
    View metrics on waste and water quality:

    ```bash
    python scripts/dashboard.py
    ```

### Outputs

Find reports and visualizations in the `outputs/` directory. Share this data to raise canal waste awareness.
