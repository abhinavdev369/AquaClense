AquaClense: An Integrated Aquatic Cleaning System
Overview
AquaClense is a software prototype designed to support the cleaning of water bodies, with a focus on canal water bodies where waste accumulation is significant. The software aims to enhance environmental sustainability by providing tools for data analysis, visualization, and public awareness, with the potential for future integration with a custom-built hardware device to remove floating debris. The ultimate goal is to scale this solution to improve water quality management practices in affected water bodies.
Objectives

Data Analysis: Collect and analyze water quality data to support predictive analysis for improved water management.
Public Awareness: Provide insights into canal waste accumulation and environmental impact through data visualization, fostering community engagement and understanding.
Future Hardware Integration: Develop software compatible with a planned hardware solution (dimensions: 190×100×150 mm) for debris removal from water surfaces.
Sustainability: Conduct development in a socially responsible, ethical, and environmentally sustainable manner, adhering to government safety standards for future deployments.

Features

Data Analysis Pipeline: Processes water quality and waste data to generate actionable insights.
Visualization Dashboard: Displays real-time metrics on canal waste and water quality to educate stakeholders and the public.
Scalable Software Design: Built to support a 5-day initial implementation at a designated site, with adaptability for future hardware integration.
Community Engagement: Tools to raise awareness about the importance of canal water body restoration.
