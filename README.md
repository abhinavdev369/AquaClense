# AquaClense: Integrated Aquatic Cleaning System

## Overview
**AquaClense** is a software prototype aimed at addressing water pollution in canal water bodies with significant waste accumulation. It provides tools for data analysis, visualization, and public awareness, designed for future integration with a hardware device to remove floating debris. The goal is to scale this solution for improved water quality management and environmental sustainability.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Process water quality and waste data for predictive water management insights.  
- **Public Awareness**: Visualize canal waste metrics to engage and educate communities.  
- **Future Hardware Integration**: Support a planned debris-removal device (190×100×150 mm).  
- **Sustainability**: Ensure ethical, socially responsible development, adhering to safety standards.

## Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Analyzes water quality and waste data.  
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Displays real-time canal waste and water quality metrics.  
- **Scalable Design**: Supports a 5-day initial deployment, adaptable for hardware integration.  
- **Community Focus**: Promotes awareness of canal restoration.
