AquaClense: An Integrated Aquatic Cleaning System

Overview

AquaClense is a software prototype designed to support the cleaning of water bodies, focusing on canal water bodies with significant waste accumulation. The software provides tools for data analysis, visualization, and public awareness, with plans for future integration with a hardware device for debris removal. The goal is to scale this solution to enhance water quality management and environmental sustainability.

Objectives





Data Analysis: Process water quality and waste data to support predictive analysis for improved water management.



Public Awareness: Visualize canal waste accumulation and environmental impact to engage and educate the community.



Future Hardware Integration: Develop software compatible with a planned hardware device (dimensions: 190×100×150 mm) for debris removal.



Sustainability: Ensure development aligns with ethical, socially responsible, and environmentally sustainable practices, adhering to government safety standards for future deployments.

Features





Data Analysis Pipeline: Processes water quality and waste data to generate actionable insights.



Visualization Dashboard: Displays real-time metrics on canal waste and water quality for stakeholders and the public.



Scalable Design: Supports a 5-day initial implementation at a designated site, adaptable for future hardware integration.



Community Engagement: Promotes awareness of canal water body restoration through accessible data.
